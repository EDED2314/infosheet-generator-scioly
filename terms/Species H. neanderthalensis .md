**Fossil Spotlight: Species Homo neanderthalensis (Neanderthals)**

**General Details:**
- **Name:** Homo neanderthalensis
- **Scientific Classification:** Species Homo neanderthalensis, Genus Homo, Family Hominidae
- **Geological Age:** Middle to Late Pleistocene (approximately 400,000 to 40,000 years ago)
- **Habitat:** Varied habitats, including grasslands, woodlands, and tundra regions
- **Fossil Type:** Hominin

**Description:**
Homo neanderthalensis, commonly known as Neanderthals, are an extinct species of human-like hominins. They are closely related to modern humans and represent a distinct lineage within the genus Homo.

**Distinctive Features:**
- **Anatomy:** Neanderthals displayed several unique morphological features. They had a robust build, with stocky bodies, and adapted to cold climates with shorter limbs and a barrel-shaped chest. Notable facial features included a prominent brow ridge, occipital bun, and a projecting mid-face.
- **Cranial Capacity:** Neanderthals had larger brains than modern humans, with an average cranial capacity within the range of Homo sapiens.
- **DNA:** Studies have revealed that Neanderthals share genetic material with some modern human populations due to interbreeding that occurred when they coexisted with early Homo sapiens.

**Paleobiology:**
Neanderthals exhibited a complex set of behaviors and characteristics, indicating cognitive abilities similar to modern humans. They made and used tools, engaged in communal living, buried their dead, and likely had some form of cultural expression.

**Geological Significance:**
The discovery of Neanderthals has been paramount in understanding human evolutionary history. Their existence represents a separate branch of the human family tree that lived alongside and interacted with early Homo sapiens, providing insights into the complex dynamics of human evolution.

**Distribution:**
Neanderthals inhabited regions across Europe and parts of western Asia. They were well-adapted to diverse habitats, with evidence indicating their presence in various climates and landscapes, including grasslands, woodlands, and even colder tundra regions.

**Extinction:**
Neanderthals became extinct around 40,000 years ago, coinciding with the time of Homo sapiens' expansion and the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition. The exact reasons for their extinction are still debated among scientists and may involve a combination of factors, including competition with Homo sapiens and environmental pressures.

**Fun Facts:**
- Neanderthals created and used tools, including finely crafted stone implements, seen as evidence of their cognitive abilities and manual dexterity.
- Recent studies suggest that Neanderthals had some cultural practices, such as the symbolic use of pigments and potentially the creation of art.

**Ecology:**
- Neanderthals inhabited a wide range of environments, from temperate woodlands to harsh tundra regions. Their adaptive traits and tool-making abilities allowed them to survive and thrive in diverse ecological settings.
- They engaged in hunting and gathering activities, with evidence of hunting large game such as mammoths, bison, and deer, as well as the gathering of plant resources.

In conclusion, Homo neanderthalensis, or Neanderthals, occupy a vital position in our understanding of human evolution. As a closely related species to modern humans, Neanderthals showcase both similarities and distinctive features. Their complex behaviors and cultural expressions highlight their cognitive capabilities and the rich tapestry of human history. The study of Neanderthal fossils provides crucial insights into the story of our species, offering glimpses into the lives and adaptations of our ancient relatives.
