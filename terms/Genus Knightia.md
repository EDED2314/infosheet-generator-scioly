**Fossil Spotlight: Genus Knightia**

**General Details:**
- **Name:** Genus Knightia
- **Scientific Classification:** Genus Knightia, Class Actinopterygii
- **Geological Age:** Eocene to Oligocene (approximately 56 to 33.9 million years ago)
- **Habitat:** Freshwater lakes and rivers
- **Fossil Type:** Fish

**Description:**
The genus Knightia comprises a group of ancient fish that existed during the Eocene and Oligocene epochs. With their beautifully preserved fossils, Knightia provides valuable insights into the prehistoric freshwater ecosystems of North America.

**Distinctive Features:**
- **Body Shape:** Knightia have elongated, slender bodies, typical of many small fish species.
- **Size:** Individual species within the genus vary in size, ranging from a few centimeters to around 15 centimeters in length.
- **Teeth:** Knightia possess small, sharp teeth that are well-suited for capturing and consuming prey.

**Paleobiology:**
Knightia were likely opportunistic feeders, consuming a range of small aquatic organisms such as insects, plankton, and other small fish. Their streamlined bodies and specialized teeth suggest they were adapted for swift swimming and efficient predation.

**Geological Significance:**
The fossils of Knightia have proven to be essential in reconstructing ancient freshwater ecosystems. Found in large numbers in certain fossil sites, such as the Green River Formation in Wyoming, USA, Knightia fossils provide valuable information about the biodiversity, community structures, and environmental conditions of these ancient habitats.

**Distribution:**
Knightia fossils have primarily been discovered in North America, particularly within the Green River Formation. This suggests a predominantly western North American distribution during the Eocene and Oligocene epochs.

**Extinction:**
Knightia and many other fish species of the Eocene-Oligocene era faced extinction as a result of changing environmental conditions. These changes included shifts in climate, water chemistry, and the overall ecology of freshwater ecosystems.
